_**XML Tag Formatting**_

XML tags follow one of two formats, as shown in the previous code snippets:

- Element tags: **<tag_name, attributes><text></tag_name>**
    - Example: **<city>"LA"</city>**
- Self-closing tags: **<tag_name, attributes />**
    - Example: **<hierarchy title="United States" />**

You will notice that both formats include:

- a **tag_name**, which is any unique identifier for a tag kind, and
- attributes, which are an optional list of pairs **attribute_name="attribute_value".**
