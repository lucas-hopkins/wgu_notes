## Software Design Process 

- The analysis phase defines a program's goals.
- The design phase defines specifics of how to build a program.
- The implementation phase involves writing the program.
- The testing phase checks that the programs correctly meets the goals.


| Phase          | Common deliverables for waterfall approach                              | Common deliverables for agile approach                            |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Analysis       | Software requirements specification document                            |                                                                   |
| Design         | UML diagrams indicating how the program's components should be designed |                                                                   |
| Implementation | Functional software product                                             | One or more functioning software components                       |
| Testing        | Functional software product that satisfies the program's goals          | Program component that satisfies a portion of the program's goals |
|                |                                                                         |                                                                   |
|                |                                                                         |                                                                   |

Requirements set early, in agreement with client

Waterfall pros

Agile/spiral pros

Progress and time to completion easily measured

Frequent developer communication

Easier to handle requirement changes

Agile/spiral cons

Waterfall cons

Mistakes noticed late may require starting over

When requirements change, can't go back to an earlier phase

Final design uncertain as iterations repeat

Cycles repeat as more and more problems are found, making product completion difficult v  v vvvvvvvv
### Waterfall

Steps with no going back
### Agile

Incremental
