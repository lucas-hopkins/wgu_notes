**ACID**
- **Atomicity** - requires that all SQL statements of a transaction be completed. The transaction should be viewed as a single logical unit of work that is indivisible.
	- 
- **Consistency** - ensures that the database is in a consistent state. This means that a transaction takes a database from one consistent state to another.
	- 
- **Isolation** - means that the data that is used during the first transaction cannot be used in another transaction until the first transaction has finished executing.
	- 
- **Durability** - It ensures that when the transaction changes are finished and committed, they cannot be undone or removed even if there is a system failure.
