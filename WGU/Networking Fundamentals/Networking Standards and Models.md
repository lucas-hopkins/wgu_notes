## 802.11 

### 802.11a
- Bandwidth up to 54 Mbps
- Frequency around 5 GHz
- Higher frequency in turn shortens the range of 802.11a networks

### 802.11b
- Bandwidth up to 11 Mbps
- Unregulated 2.4 GHz signaling frequency
- Often used by vendors to lower production costs
- Can incur interference from devices using the same range
	- Microwaves
	- Phones

### 802.11g
- Combines both a & b
- Uses 2.4 GHz
- Supports bandwidth up to 54 Mbps
- Backward Compatible

### 802.11n
- Greater badwidth
	- Utilizes multiple wireless signals and antennas instead of just one
		- MIMO
	- Supports 300 Mbps
	- Superior range

### 802.11ac
- Dual band (2.4/5)
- Backward compatible with b/g/n
- Much higher bandwidth on both bands


## Ethernet LANs & Switching
### 10Base-T
- 10 indicates the speed of transmission
- Base is the Signaling used
- T in this case means Twisted Pair Cabling

### 100Base-TX (Fast Ethernet)
- 100 Mbps
- TX means in this case - Twisted Pair Cabling & Full Duplex

### 1000Base-SX (Gigabit Ethernet)
- 1000 Mbps
- SX means shortwave length over fiver

### 10GBase-SR
- 10G speed
-  Shortwave length - extended range

### 40GBase-SR4
- 40G speed

### 100GBase-SR10
- Short/Long Wavelength ethernet
